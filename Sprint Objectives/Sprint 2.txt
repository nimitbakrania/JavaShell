- Research suitable design patterns, weighing the pros and cons of each, and note whether 
they fit the programming paradigmn in which we have set up.
- Implement a basic parser that would allow the testing of the existing commands. 
- Design a suitable testing environment for faster and rather abrupt testing of added 
functionality.
