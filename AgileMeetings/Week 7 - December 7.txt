Week 7 - December 7

-------------------

What have we done since last time?
- All of the commands are now implemented as described in the spec-
ification. There are bugs, though minute. 
-Written J-unit tests for each of the commands.

What do we plan to do now?
- For some of the J-unit tests, there are fail cases that must be fixed.
-As well as this, the functionality between running on docker and on normal 
terminal is different, and so must be fixed. 
- Created a model for adding tests that are independent of the machine that runs it

What are we each working on right now?
- Anirudh - Fix failing test cases.
- Julian - Fixing failing test cases and adding docker functionality.
- Nimit - Creating a model for adding test cases. 

Am we blocked on anything?
 - No
